<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/me.png" alt="Paolo Corti, Thinking in GIS" />

I have been glued (without hope of freedom) to a computer since the early 80's when I have been developing some [Zork-like][1] adventure games on my Commodore Vic20/64/Amiga 1000. I landed in GIS in the late 90's, writing some (now museum-worthy) AML code for ARC/INFO and then migrating to ArcObjects and finally to Open Source GIS.

I have been now working for more than 15 years in the geospatial industry: after working with proprietary solutions for some years, in 2006 I finally proudly switched to open source technologies and Python.

I am a Geospatial Engineer Fellow at the [Center for Geographic Analysis of the University of Harvard][2] and in the past I worked as a software architect, developer and analyst for organizations such as [UN World Food Programme][3], [EU Joint Research Centre][4] and the [Italian Government][5].

I am an OSGeo Charter member and member of the [pycsw][6] and [GeoNode][7] Project Steering Committees. I am co-author of the [PostGIS Cookbook by Packt][8].
